#### Desktop design

### My process

First we organized the HTML structure for the mobile design including the grid property on the images and we added the layouts. Then, we put a @media to make the changes asked for the desktop design.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Query

### What I learned

- Text orientation property to set the orientation of the characters.

```
	writing-mode: vertical-rl;
    text-orientation: mixed;
		
```

- Grid property to assign positions to the components.

```
	display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
		
```
